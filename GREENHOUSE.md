hi jay,
my name is eric.
i'd be happy to help out when i can (although i have a full time job).
i'd like to drop off fiverr of course, its kind of a set back working with them (even aside from fees).
my usual rate is around 50 or 55 per hour, but i'm flexible and always willing to hear about
new projects or small utilities / tools that could peak my interest.
and you are of course more than welcome to reach out anytime with design questions or for advice, etc.
i'm always happy to jump into conversation.
